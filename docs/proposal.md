## 2. Background

**What is it about?**  
The AI-Powered Meal Planner is a personalized system that helps users generate daily meal plans based on their **calorie requirements and nutritional preferences**. It leverages **unsupervised learning (clustering)** to categorize foods into meaningful nutritional groups and uses a **Hugging Face LLM** to generate **meal plans and recipes** in a user-friendly format. The output includes **recipes, grocery lists, and a macros donut chart** to show nutritional balance.  

**Why does it matter?**  
- Many existing meal planning tools provide static or minimally personalized recommendations.  
- This system combines **clustering + LLM-based generation**, allowing **dynamic, actionable, and fully personalized meal plans**.  
- Supports users in meeting health goals while saving time and simplifying meal planning.  
- The **LLM-generated output** delivers complete daily meal plans and recipes, making it immediately usable.  

**Research Questions:**  
1. How can clustering algorithms categorize foods into meaningful nutritional groups?  
2. How can LLMs generate daily meal plans aligned with user-specific calorie and nutrition requirements?  
3. How can the system present meal plans in a clear, actionable, and understandable format?

## 3. Data

**Data Sources:**  
- USDA Foods dataset (~50,000 rows), collected via API queries  

**Data Size:**  
- ~50 MB  

**Data Shape:**  
- Rows: 50,000  
- Columns: 9  

**Time Period:**  
- Static dataset; not time-bound  

**Row Representation:**  
- Each row represents one food item with its nutritional information  

**Data Dictionary:**  

| Column       | Type    | Definition / Notes |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| fdcId      | int64  | Unique ID for each food item |
| description| object | Food name/description |
| dataType   | object | Type of data record (Branded, SR Legacy, etc.) |
| calories   | float64| Energy per serving (kcal) |
| protein_g  | float64| Protein content (g) |
| carbs_g    | float64| Carbohydrate content (g) |
| fat_g      | float64| Fat content (g) |
| fiber_g    | float64| Fiber content (g) |
| sugar_g    | float64| Sugar content (not available, dropped in preprocessing) |

**Target / Label:**  
- Unsupervised learning â†’ cluster labels assigned to each food item (e.g., High Protein, Low Fat, Low Carb, etc.)  

**Features / Predictors:**  
- calories, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g, fiber_g  
- **Note:** Few features were collected via API queries.  

**Output:**  
- The final **output** of the system is the **daily meal plan and recipes generated by the Hugging Face LLM**, along with a **grocery list** and **macros visualization**.

## 4. Methodology

1. **User Input:**  
   - Calorie requirement  
   - Meal plan type (dropdown with cluster names)  

2. **Data Filtering:**  
   - Filter foods based on selected cluster  

3. **Meal Generation (LLM):**  
   - Use **Hugging Face LLM** to generate **3 meals per day** from filtered dataset  
   - Output includes **recipes and grocery list** in user-friendly language  

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Display **macros donut chart** to show nutritional balance of the generated meals
